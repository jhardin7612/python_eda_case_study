## *Questions*

## *Curation*

## Exploration

## Our Approach
With respect to time and experience levels we decided to create a subset of the data that focused on the Balkan and Baltic regions. The Baltic region was already included, however we needed to create the Balkan region ourselves. To do this, we extracted the countries, agregated the data, and used the mean of that subset for the populating the rest of the columns.
